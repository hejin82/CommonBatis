CommonBatis
===========

    a mybatis plugin that provide common dao. you even don't need any xml or interface to manipulate database. i.e. with this plugin you can use mybatis in criteria serach like hibernate~
    mybatis is a great framework. nevertheless, it just encapsulate data access layer, for us to do some of the object-relational mapping. The expense of having to write xml configuration file. relative to Hibernate we have to write a lot of SQL. in most cases we do not need to write sql will be greatly improved development efficiency. many people may suggest that we can use mybatis-generator. so. i had a try. from a five columns table,it generated 5 files with more than 800 lines of code! it's much more than i can bear. Hibernate is very powerful, perfect ORM framework, but this is its strength is also its shortcomings. so, in order to fill this gap. i write this plugin for mybatis. the plugin working well now. it has working well in some of my project. but also there are many problem should be repaired in the months ahead, any pull request will be pleasure!
